TEST 5: KEY-BASED CONTAINMENT (500K rows) - Fair Comparison
================================================================================

Both sexp @>> and jsonb @> use KEY-BASED containment semantics:
  - Match by nested key/value pairs
  - Order independent within objects/lists
  - Partial matching (needle is subset of container)

--- sexp @>>: Filter by settings.theme = dark (33% selectivity) ---
